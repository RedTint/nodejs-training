### Story

Tech Story: Build a layered architecture for the customer and user service

### Assumptions

### UAC

- Demo that we have a service defined for customer
- Demo that we have a controller defined for customer
- Demo that we have a router defined for customer
- Demo that we have an entrypoint (index.js) defined for customer
- Demo that mock data is injected for customer

- Demo that we have a service defined for user
- Demo that we have a controller defined for user
- Demo that we have a router defined for user
- Demo that we have an entrypoint (index.js) defined for user
- Demo that mock data is injected for user
